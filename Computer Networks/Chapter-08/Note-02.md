# DNS

## Introduction

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a hierarchical and decentralized system used to **translate human-readable domain names** (e.g., `www.example.com`) into **machine-readable IP addresses** (e.g., `192.0.2.1`) that computers use to identify each other on a network. DNS serves as the **"phonebook of the internet,"** enabling users to access websites and other online resources using easily remembered names instead of numerical addresses.

---

### **Key Functions of DNS**

1. **Domain Name Resolution**

   - Converts domain names into corresponding IP addresses.
   - Example: Resolving `www.google.com` to `142.250.64.78`.

2. **Load Balancing**

   - Distributes traffic to multiple servers by resolving a single domain to different IP addresses based on load or geography.

3. **Email Routing**

   - Supports email delivery by mapping mail servers using MX (Mail Exchange) records.

4. **Reverse DNS Lookup**
   - Resolves an IP address back to a domain name (used in logging and diagnostics).

---

### **Components of DNS**

1. **Domain Name**

   - Hierarchical name structure divided into levels separated by dots:
     - **Root Domain:** The highest level, represented by a dot (`.`), typically implicit.
     - **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** E.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`.
     - **Second-Level Domain (SLD):** Specific name registered under a TLD, e.g., `example` in `example.com`.
     - **Subdomain:** Additional levels under the SLD, e.g., `blog.example.com`.

2. **DNS Records**

   - **A Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
   - **AAAA Record:** Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
   - **CNAME (Canonical Name):** Alias for another domain name.
   - **MX Record:** Specifies mail servers for the domain.
   - **NS Record:** Specifies authoritative name servers for a domain.
   - **PTR Record:** Supports reverse DNS lookups.
   - **TXT Record:** Holds arbitrary text data (e.g., SPF for email validation).

3. **Name Servers**
   - Servers that store DNS records and respond to DNS queries.

---

### **DNS Resolution Process**

1. **User Query:** A user types a domain name into a browser.
2. **Recursive Resolver:** The user's device sends a query to a **DNS resolver** (usually managed by the ISP or configured service like Google Public DNS).
3. **Root Server:** The resolver contacts a **root server** to locate the TLD server (e.g., `.com`).
4. **TLD Server:** The TLD server provides the authoritative name server for the specific domain.
5. **Authoritative Server:** The authoritative server returns the IP address for the domain.
6. **Response to User:** The resolver sends the IP address back to the user's device, allowing the browser to establish a connection.

---

### **Types of DNS Servers**

1. **Recursive Resolver**
   - Receives the user's query and performs the lookup process.
2. **Root Name Server**
   - Directs queries to appropriate TLD servers.
3. **TLD Name Server**
   - Handles requests for domains within a specific TLD (e.g., `.com`, `.org`).
4. **Authoritative Name Server**
   - Provides the final answer, containing the IP address or other requested records.

---

### **Advantages of DNS**

- **User-Friendly:** Makes it easier to access websites using names instead of IP addresses.
- **Scalability:** Handles billions of queries globally every day.
- **Redundancy:** Distributed architecture ensures fault tolerance.
- **Security Enhancements:** DNSSEC adds cryptographic authentication to protect against certain attacks.

---

### **Common DNS Services**

- **Public DNS Providers:** Google Public DNS (`8.8.8.8`), Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1`), OpenDNS.
- **Dynamic DNS (DDNS):** Allows automatic updates of DNS records for devices with dynamic IPs.

---

### **DNS Issues**

- **DNS Cache Poisoning:** Malicious redirection of DNS queries.
- **Slow Resolution:** Poorly configured DNS servers can delay browsing.
- **Dependency:** Internet functionality relies heavily on DNS.

---

In summary, **DNS** is a cornerstone of the internet, enabling seamless navigation by translating user-friendly domain names into machine-friendly IP addresses. Its decentralized, hierarchical structure ensures speed, reliability, and scalability.

## DNS Types

DNS (Domain Name System) can be categorized into different types based on functionality, role, and records. Here's an overview:

---

### **1. Types of DNS Based on Functionality**

#### **a. Recursive DNS**

- **Purpose:** Acts as an intermediary to resolve DNS queries on behalf of the client.
- **Process:**
  - Receives a query from a client (e.g., browser).
  - Queries other DNS servers (root, TLD, authoritative) until it resolves the name.
  - Caches the results for future queries.
- **Example:** ISP DNS resolvers, Google Public DNS (`8.8.8.8`).

#### **b. Root DNS**

- **Purpose:** Serves as the starting point for resolving domain names.
- **Process:**
  - Directs queries to the appropriate TLD (Top-Level Domain) server.
  - Maintained by organizations like ICANN.
- **Number:** 13 logical root servers, distributed globally (e.g., `A.root-servers.net`).

#### **c. TLD (Top-Level Domain) DNS**

- **Purpose:** Handles domains under specific TLDs (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`).
- **Process:**
  - Directs queries to the authoritative server for a domain.
  - Examples: VeriSign manages `.com` and `.net`; Public Interest Registry manages `.org`.

#### **d. Authoritative DNS**

- **Purpose:** Provides the definitive answer to DNS queries for domains.
- **Process:**
  - Stores DNS records like A, MX, TXT, and NS.
  - Example: If `example.com` has `192.0.2.1` as its IP, the authoritative server stores this information.

---

### **2. Types of DNS Based on Role**

#### **a. Primary (Master) DNS**

- **Purpose:** Stores the original, writable copy of DNS records for a domain.
- **Role:**
  - Administrators make changes here (e.g., adding subdomains).
  - Updates secondary servers with changes.

#### **b. Secondary (Slave) DNS**

- **Purpose:** Stores a read-only copy of DNS records fetched from the primary DNS server.
- **Role:**
  - Provides redundancy and load balancing.
  - Ensures availability if the primary server goes down.

#### **c. Caching DNS**

- **Purpose:** Temporarily stores DNS query results to speed up subsequent lookups.
- **Role:**
  - Reduces latency and server load.
  - Example: Local resolver on a user's device or ISP DNS caching.

---

### **3. Types of DNS Records**

#### **a. A (Address) Record**

- Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
- Example: `example.com → 192.0.2.1`.

#### **b. AAAA Record**

- Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.
- Example: `example.com → 2001:0db8::1`.

#### **c. CNAME (Canonical Name) Record**

- Creates an alias for another domain.
- Example: `www.example.com → example.com`.

#### **d. MX (Mail Exchange) Record**

- Specifies mail servers for handling emails for a domain.
- Example: `example.com → mail.example.com`.

#### **e. NS (Name Server) Record**

- Specifies the authoritative DNS servers for a domain.
- Example: `example.com → ns1.example.com`.

#### **f. TXT (Text) Record**

- Holds arbitrary text data, often used for security.
- Example: `example.com → SPF or DKIM configuration`.

#### **g. PTR (Pointer) Record**

- Used for reverse DNS lookups (IP to domain name).
- Example: `192.0.2.1 → example.com`.

#### **h. SRV (Service) Record**

- Specifies services like SIP or LDAP for a domain.
- Example: `_sip._tcp.example.com → sipserver.example.com`.

---

### **4. Special DNS Types**

#### **a. Dynamic DNS (DDNS)**

- Automatically updates DNS records to reflect changes in a device's IP address.
- Used for devices with dynamic IPs (e.g., home servers).
- Example: No-IP, DynDNS.

#### **b. Public DNS**

- DNS servers available for public use.
- Examples:
  - Google Public DNS (`8.8.8.8`).
  - Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1`).

#### **c. Private DNS**

- Used within private networks (e.g., enterprise setups).
- Example: Internal DNS servers resolving local resources.

#### **d. Forwarding DNS**

- Forwards queries it cannot resolve to another DNS server.
- Often used in conjunction with recursive servers.

---

### **Summary**

DNS types can be broadly categorized based on **functionality (recursive, authoritative), role (primary, caching), and records (A, MX, etc.).** Each type plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and efficient domain resolution, balancing redundancy, security, and performance.

## HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP | All Application Layer Protocols

### **Application Layer Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and POP**

The **Application Layer** of the OSI model provides protocols to enable communication between users and network services. Here’s an overview of the four key protocols: **HTTP**, **FTP**, **SMTP**, and **POP**.

---
