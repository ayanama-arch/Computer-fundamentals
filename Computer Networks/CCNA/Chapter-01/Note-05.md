## TCP/IP Protocol suite

The **TCP/IP protocol suite** is a set of communication protocols used for interconnecting network devices on the internet. It stands for **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**, and it is the foundation of modern networking. Unlike the OSI model, which has seven layers, TCP/IP is generally structured into **four layers**.

### TCP/IP Layers and Their Functions:

#### 1. **Application Layer**:

- **Purpose**: Provides the interface between the network and the application software.
- **Key Protocols**:
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: For web communication.
  - **SMTP, IMAP, POP3**: For email communication.
  - **FTP**: For file transfers.
  - **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
  - **SNMP**: For network management.
- **Corresponds to**: The Application, Presentation, and Session layers of the OSI model.

#### 2. **Transport Layer**:

- **Purpose**: Ensures reliable or unreliable delivery of data across the network.
- **Key Protocols**:
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
    - Reliable, connection-oriented protocol.
    - Ensures data is delivered without errors, in the correct order.
  - **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
    - Unreliable, connectionless protocol.
    - Used for applications requiring speed over reliability (e.g., video streaming, gaming).
- **Corresponds to**: The Transport layer of the OSI model.

#### 3. **Internet Layer**:

- **Purpose**: Handles the addressing, routing, and delivery of data packets.
- **Key Protocols**:
  - **IP (Internet Protocol)**:
    - Responsible for addressing and routing packets.
    - Versions: IPv4 and IPv6.
  - **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**:
    - Used for error messages and diagnostic tools like `ping`.
  - **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
    - Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.
  - **NAT (Network Address Translation)**:
    - Maps private IP addresses to a public IP address.
- **Corresponds to**: The Network layer of the OSI model.

#### 4. **Network Access Layer** (Link Layer):

- **Purpose**: Handles the physical transmission of data across the network.
- **Key Components**:
  - Protocols and technologies like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and PPP.
  - MAC addresses and physical hardware interaction.
- **Corresponds to**: The Data Link and Physical layers of the OSI model.

### Comparison: TCP/IP vs. OSI Model

| **TCP/IP Layer**     | **Equivalent OSI Layers**          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Application Layer    | Application, Presentation, Session |
| Transport Layer      | Transport                          |
| Internet Layer       | Network                            |
| Network Access Layer | Data Link, Physical                |

### Strengths of TCP/IP:

- **Widely Adopted**: Backbone of the internet.
- **Scalable**: Works for small networks and the global internet.
- **Robust**: Handles errors efficiently.
- **Interoperable**: Supports diverse hardware and software.

---

### Weaknesses of TCP/IP:

- **Not Strictly Layered**: Some functionalities overlap.
- **Less Modular**: OSI provides clearer distinctions between layers.
- **Limited in Modern Features**: Gradual evolution has added complexities (e.g., IPv4 exhaustion requiring IPv6).

The TCP/IP modelâ€™s simplicity and practicality have made it the de facto standard for networking today.

## Protocol Data Unit

A **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)** is a packet of data that is exchanged between layers of the network protocol stack. Each layer in a network model (like the OSI model or TCP/IP model) has its own specific type of PDU, which includes control information (headers and trailers) and the actual data being transmitted.

### PDUs in Different Layers of the OSI Model

Each layer of the OSI model deals with a different PDU type:

1. **Application Layer, Presentation Layer, and Session Layer**:

   - **PDU Name**: **Data**
   - **Description**: At these upper layers, the PDU is simply referred to as "data," as it represents the information being exchanged between applications.

2. **Transport Layer**:

   - **PDU Name**: **Segment** (TCP) / **Datagram** (UDP)
   - **Description**: The transport layer divides the data into smaller units (segments or datagrams) and adds headers to ensure proper delivery.

3. **Network Layer**:

   - **PDU Name**: **Packet**
   - **Description**: A packet is created when the network layer adds addressing information (e.g., source and destination IP addresses).

4. **Data Link Layer**:

   - **PDU Name**: **Frame**
   - **Description**: A frame is formed by encapsulating the packet with a header and a trailer that include information such as MAC addresses and error-checking data (CRC).

5. **Physical Layer**:
   - **PDU Name**: **Bits**
   - **Description**: The frame is converted into a stream of bits (1s and 0s) for physical transmission over the medium (e.g., cables, fiber optics, or wireless).

---

### PDU Structure

A typical PDU contains:

- **Header**: Contains control information like source/destination addresses, sequence numbers, and error detection codes.
- **Payload (Data)**: The actual user data or the encapsulated PDU from the higher layer.
- **Trailer**: Found in some layers (e.g., Data Link Layer), providing error-checking or framing information.

---

### PDUs in the TCP/IP Model

- **Application Layer**: Data
- **Transport Layer**: Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP)
- **Internet Layer**: Packet
- **Network Access Layer**: Frame -> Bits

### Summary Table

| **Layer**   | **OSI PDU Name** | **Example**                  |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Application | Data             | HTTP request, email          |
| Transport   | Segment          | TCP/UDP header + data        |
| Network     | Packet           | IP header + segment          |
| Data Link   | Frame            | Ethernet frame               |
| Physical    | Bits             | Voltage levels, light pulses |

Understanding PDUs is essential for grasping how data moves across a network and how layers in network protocols interact.

## Application layer protocol
